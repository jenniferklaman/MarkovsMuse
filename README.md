Markov Chain Text Generator
This repository contains a Python implementation of a Markov chain text generator, which uses a combination of transition matrix probabilities and the Monte Carlo approach to generate realistic and diverse text.

Overview
The Markov chain text generator is a statistical model that analyzes a given corpus of text and generates new text based on the patterns and structures it identifies. This implementation uses a transition matrix to store the word-to-word probabilities, and incorporates the Monte Carlo approach to introduce an element of randomness into the text generation process.

Features
Analyzes a given corpus of text to build a transition matrix of word-to-word probabilities
Uses the Monte Carlo approach to generate text based on the transition matrix probabilities
Allows for customizable starting words and text lengths
Generates realistic and diverse text that balances predictability and randomness
Usage
To use the Markov chain text generator, simply clone this repository and replace the corpus variable in the code with the path to your own text file. You can then call the generate_text function with a starting word and desired text length to generate new text.

For example:

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
print(generate_text("once", 20))
This would generate 20 words of text starting with the word "once".
